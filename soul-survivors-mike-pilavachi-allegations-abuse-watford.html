His victims spoke out to reveal that they were encouraged to receive full-body oil massages in their underwear in Rev Canon Pilavachi’s bedroom, as well as take part in vigorous wrestling matches that could last as long as 20 minutes at a time – sometimes in church.</p><p>Two weeks ago, a church investigation concluded that Rev Canon Pilavachi, who has been suspended and has resigned from Soul Survivor, had abused victims. It said that safeguarding concerns relating to his leadership and ministry spanned 40 years.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">‘Saying goodbye to Mike’</h2><p>On Tuesday night, Soul Survivor Watford held a meeting for members, attended by around 200 people, to address the congregations’ concerns and answer questions.</p><p>The Telegraph understands that a congregant asked a question “about saying goodbye to Mike” and that the question prompted applause from some other congregants.</p><p>Responding to some congregants’ support for Rev Canon Pilavachi, one of the victims of his alleged abuse said that if they were aware of what had happened “perhaps then they would stop applauding and instead weep for the abuse victims, rather than celebrate him and afford him the kind of dignity they have been denied at every stage”.</p><p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the victim added: “After everything that was disclosed and proven true, how could the congregation at Soul Survivor suggest a special meeting to thank Mike and the room break out in spontaneous applause?</p><p>“This same man cast out and shunned the very people he was abusing. The same trustees ignored and iced out victim after victim.&nbsp;</p><p>“These incidents are the tip of a devastating iceberg of abuse. This is 2023. Victims are reeling. The church is looking to you. Do better Soul Survivor.”</p><p>It is understood that the meeting came in the wake of congregants complaining about the lack of communication regarding the various reports and investigations.</p><p>The panel comprised Rev Canon Tim Lomax, representing the Bishop of St Albans; David Mitchell, chairman of Soul Survivor WatfordL and Jez Hirst, the safeguarding adviser for the Diocese of St Albans.</p><p>It was in the 1990s, when Rev Canon Pilavachi began taking his mission work abroad as the Soul Survivor brand went global, that he is alleged by his victims to have “left a trail of broken, young male adults scattered all around the world”.</p><h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal">Spiritual authority</h2><p>Rev Canon Pilavachi was suspended from Soul Survivor in May and he resigned in June.&nbsp;</p><p>All the while, the Church of England’s <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>National Safeguarding Team</a> (NST) and the Diocese of St Albans were conducting an internal investigation, which prompted more than 100 people to come forward with allegations, and which concluded earlier this month.</p><p>It found that “he used his spiritual authority to control people and that his coercive and controlling behaviour led to inappropriate relationships, the physical wrestling of youths and massaging of young male interns.”</p><p>As a result of the findings, Soul Survivor commissioned an independent review to be led by <a class=ck-custom-link href=#>Fiona Scolding</a> KC, with a full report to be published upon conclusion.</p><p>It is understood that her report is hoped to be published between January and March 2024, and based on the transcripts of the NST’s interviews, subject to witnesses’ permission, as well as additional interviews.</p><p>In a statement, the Soul Survivor Watford trustees said: “We held this meeting to keep the church informed of the latest developments, respond to their questions and concerns and share the information that is currently available about Fiona Scolding KC’s Review.</p><p>“While the terms of reference are still to be finalised, we have commissioned a robust, independent investigation that offers transparency to the victims of Mike Pilavachi’s abuse, and will implement the recommendations to ensure nothing like this ever happens again at Soul Survivor Watford.”</p><p>They added: “We are committed to helping our church body work through the ramifications of the report findings, prioritising support and compassion for the victims and recognition of the impact of Mike Pilavachi’s abuse.</p><p>“While in the Christian faith we believe that God’s forgiveness is available to everyone, this does not mean overlooking the consequences and impact of their actions.</p><p>“It would be totally inappropriate, and hurtful for his victims, for Mike Pilavachi to attend Soul Survivor Watford. We made this clear at Tuesday’s meeting.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9ramhoaWR%2FdXvSqKylZaOqv7e11aiprGWdnrimec%2Bio5qukZi1qnnApaOen5GptrC60maYm62jmnq4rdOfpqucXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsoul-survivors-mike-pilavachi-allegations-abuse-watford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsoul-survivors-mike-pilavachi-allegations-abuse-watford.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsoul-survivors-mike-pilavachi-allegations-abuse-watford.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsoul-survivors-mike-pilavachi-allegations-abuse-watford.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsoul-survivors-mike-pilavachi-allegations-abuse-watford.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsoul-survivors-mike-pilavachi-allegations-abuse-watford.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-in-the-family-of-connor-from-love-on-the-spectrum-meet-his-mother-sister-and-brothers.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-in-the-family-of-connor-from-love-on-the-spectrum-meet-his-mother-sister-and-brothers.html>Who is in the family of Connor from Love on the Spectrum?
