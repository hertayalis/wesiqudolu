<time>01 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Alleah Taylor has opened up about the assault she endured while in a relationship with the former Seahawks offensive lineman Chad Wheeler. Taylor has talked about the ordeal she had faced from Wheeler and believes that he should serve time in jail for the vicious assault. Taylor shared several graphic photos that show her bloodied face after the alleged attack, according to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail.</a></p><p>On January 22, 2021, Wheeler, 27, was charged with first-degree domestic violence assault and domestic violence unlawful imprisonment after it was reported that he allegedly attacked Taylor over the weekend. He was also charged with resisting arrest. Wheeler was later released on $400,000 bail and later pleaded not guilty. Taylor recently sat down with CBS This Morning, where she shared details about her experience with Wheeler in late January.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES:</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Who is Chad Wheeler’s girlfriend?

In 2019, she reportedly participated in the Miss Washington USA 2019 contest but couldn’t make it to the final round. As per her profile from Miss Washington USA, she has worked as an Operational Manager, Model, and a TV host/reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor started seeing Wheeler in mid-2020, and on the hours leading up to the January 23 attack, Wheeler texted her that he had shaved his head. As per Taylor, Wheeler cutting his long hair worried her as he loved his long curls. When she came home, she found Wheeler trying to stay normal and calm, but as time went on, he “started going downhill emotionally”. Taylor stated that Wheeler quickly entered into a dark place and reportedly asked Taylor to “bow down.”</p><p>“And I asked him why. And he didn’t respond. He just told me to bow down again. And I told him no. And he immediately grabbed my neck. And that’s when things began,” Taylor recalled.</p><p>Wheeler, who previously played two seasons with the New York Giants, did not react to Taylor’s injuries. When she had touched her face, she found that she was bleeding. She quickly ran towards the bathroom to check and call 911, while Wheeler reportedly stood by the doorway saying, “Wow, you’re, you’re still alive”.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“I had touched my face.

I have bolts, and steel, and a steel plate I'm gonna have forever in my arm... I'm gonna have...gonna have to deal with this the rest of my life," Taylor said.</p><p>Following the incident, Wheeler apologized to Taylor and announced that he is stepping away from football. From a now-deleted Twitter account, he reportedly tweeted that he is deeply sorry for all the pain and suffering his manic episode has caused to Taylor and her family. However, Taylor has not accepted the apology. When asked whether Wheeler should be put behind bars for his actions, she said, “Yes. Yes. I definitely do think that he should.”&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>former seattle seahawks player chad wheeler plead not guilty to first-degree assault domestic violence for allegedly choking his african american girlfriend last month. but in a twitter post that has been deleted, he apologized for causing her “pain and suffering.”⁣<br>⁣ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Vs35ohZAxr</a></p>— Jenesse Center (@JenerationJ) <a href=#>February 5, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Prior abuse case:</h2><p>This was not the first time Wheeler has been a part of domestic abuse. In 2015, he was involved in an incident on the University of Southern California campus where he allegedly punched walls and windows. After the police arrived at the location, he got into an altercation with them that led the police officers to shoot him with multiple bean bag rounds. Wheeler was later detained by the police but not arrested. He was later moved to protective custody for a psychiatric evaluation.</p><p>It was reported back in 2015 that he was possibly “under the influence of drugs or alcohol”.
