In November 2017, she pitched her STEM business on Shark Tank.</p><p>Albrechtsen entered the Tank looking for $200,000 in exchange for 5% equity. She struck a deal with Daymond John: $200,000 for a 25% stake.

This equals a $4 million valuation. She gives her pitch, tells her story, and displays her toys.<br>After her presentation, she brings the Sharks on stage to test them out.</p><p>Richard is the first to leave, and to his surprise, he is given a doll of himself. Sharmi, in fact, has dolls of all of the Sharks.</p><p>The two young ladies begin teaching Richard how to code after the Sharks have taken their places.</p><p>She revealed that the company has only been in business for less than six months, and she informs the sharks that they have already made $250,000 in sales.</p><p>Robert then inquires about the $250,000 in sales, which Sharmi explains was generated by a combination of wholesalers, stores, and Amazon.<br>When asked where the items are now available, she says they can be purchased on their website for $79.99.</p><p>When the sharks inquire about production costs, she responds that each item costs $18 to produce.</p><p>Daymond is enamored with it, but he makes a Sharky offer of $200,000 for 30% of the company. He wants to sell the toys on his own.</p><p>Because Robert believes that the toy industry is difficult, he is leaving.</p><p>Lori believes Daymond’s offer is the best one, and she is departing.</p><p>Richard is impressed by her efforts, but he tells her that he doesn’t believe he can contribute to the project and thus withdraws as well.</p><p>Finally, the focus shifts to Mark, the last shark standing. To her chagrin, he also backs out.</p><p>In response to Daymond’s offer, Sharmi asks if he will consider lowering it to $200,000 for a 20% stake, to which he says no.</p><p>Trying her luck again, she makes another counteroffer—$200,000 for 25%. Finally, the shark agrees that the effort was worthwhile.</p><p>He walks up to her and quickly embraces her after completing the transaction.</p><h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>What Happened to SmartGurlz after the Shark Tank Pitch?</span></strong></h2><p>This company’s sales skyrocketed after the show aired, as they always do. Sharmi was unfazed by the fact that the transaction with Daymond never materialized.</p><p>In 2018, sales amounted to $1.2 million. She raised an additional $525,000 in 2019 through WeFunder.</p><p>SmartGurlz also announced a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Walmart to launch a new product line in the fall of 2019.</p><p>SmartGurlz was also named the IEEE Women in Engineering Leadership Conference’s Best Start-up.</p><p>In 2019, she also collaborated with Pitsco Education to develop Smart Buddies, an online coding curriculum for third through fifth-grade students.<br>Pitsco provides courses to schools across the United States. Pitsco was required to acquire $5.5 million in merchandise over a three-year period under the terms of the agreement.</p><p>Because of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, they made the curriculum available online, which will remain after the epidemic has passed.</p><p>The company is still doing well as of June 2021, and Sharmi expects to end the year with more than $20 million in revenue.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6i6or7TZp6uqpyveq%2Bx02auqKqknXx3fphxZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsmart-gurlz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsmart-gurlz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsmart-gurlz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsmart-gurlz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsmart-gurlz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsmart-gurlz-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leather-jacket-styles-8547905.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leather-jacket-styles-8547905.html>13 Leather Jacket Styles That Are Always On Trend</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./julia-sutton-death.html>Shocked: Julia Sutton Death Obituary News; What happened to Julia Sutton?
