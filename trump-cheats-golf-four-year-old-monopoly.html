When club members were supposedly “surprised” to see Trump enjoying a five-point by the second day, organizers were told that he had retroactively decided a strong round on Thursday, two days before the tournament started, would count as his Saturday score.</p><p data-characters=25 data-current-count=25 data-injectable=false>Nothing fishy about that!</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>The irony was apparently too much for Reilly, author the 2019 book Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, who subsequently called out the 76-year-old alleged cheater.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>“How could Trump ‘win’ a two-day championship at his course in Florida this weekend when he spent most of Saturday at a funeral in North Carolina?” Reilly tweeted on Monday. “Same way he’s won all of his tourneys.

And if you cheat at golf, you’re probably going to cheat on your wife. And if you cheat at golf, you’re probably going to cheat on your taxes.
