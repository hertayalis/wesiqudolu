He lives a quiet life and hasn't revealed much about himself. His parents seldom post about him on their social media as well so it's hard to learn about his life.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Elijah's Parents, Flex And Shanice</h2><p>Elijah Alexander Knox is still young to be working right now. So, we will be focusing on his parent's wealth instead. His father, <a href=#><strong>Flex Alexander</strong></a> has an estimated net worth of <strong>$5 Million</strong>. His mother, Shanice has an estimated net worth of<strong> $250,000</strong> respectively.</p><p>Flex's primary source of income is acting and his film <i>Snakes on a Plane</i> made<strong> $34 Million</strong> at the box office.

The fact that they stayed together even after they lost all their money just proves that their love is pure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/2/330667412_2122849881245978_1168143040486792395_n%20(1)-1677742049530.jpg><p>The story of how Flex and Shanice met is pretty sweet. The two lived in the same building in San Fernando Valley and one day, they crossed paths when they both had to use an elevator.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though that was Flex and Shanice's first encounter they were aware of each other being a celebrity. That's how they started talking and soon love blossomed between the two.</p><h2>The Financial Struggle Of Elijah's Parents</h2><p>Elijah's parents would have been much richer if the real estate market hadn't crashed during the 2010s. Flex and Shanice almost went bankrupt because of this.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow><i>Page Six</i></a> has reported that Flex and Shanice had bought a lot of properties as a long-term investment but the market crash made them poor. The article also says that the entire family was even forced to leave their LA Home.&nbsp;</p><p>Elijah's parents have been each other's backbone in their marriage. They have dealt with all the highs and lows together. Of course, having no choice but to leave their home due to lack of finances was the worst time of their life.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Flex and Shanice never stopped caring about each other. Flex once even borrowed $350 from his friend to celebrate his marriage anniversary with Shanice.</p><h2>Has An Older Sister&nbsp;</h2><p>The birth of Elijah Alexander Knox wasn't the first time <i>One on One</i> actor, Flex and his wife, Shanice had become parents.

She only has one song on her Spotify at the time of this writing called <i>At Your Best (You Are Love)</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides that, Imani&nbsp;is only on TikTok doing a lot of cover songs for fun. Her mother also loves to promote her work through Instagram.</p><h2>Elijah Is Trying To Make A Career In Music</h2><p>Elijah Alexander Knox also wants to make a career in music like his sister, Imani.

His grandma, Crystal has a bit of a media appearance in the tv series <i>Unsung</i> where she appeared for two episodes.</p><h2>Flex Was Previously Accused Of Sexual Harassment</h2><p>Elijah's father, Flex many years back found himself in trouble after a case of sexual harassment popped up.
