Entertainers have world-renowned fame, lavish lifestyles, and the ability to connect with like-minded individuals. That said, celebrities are people just like us and tend to go through similar situations. Case in point: dealing with heartbreak.</p><p>Actor <a href=#>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> is one of Hollywood’s A-listers and was once an eligible bachelorette. However, navigating the dating field in Hollywood is a major risk that can leave you heartbroken or blissfully in love.</p><p>Like most folks, Gwyneth has seen her share of heartbreak — specifically, during her relationship with <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> — but she’s since been able to bounce back.</p><p>Now that folks are relating to Gwyneth’s failed relationship with Brad, it’s only right we take a deep dive into the Goop founder’s relationship history.</p><p>Here’s the tea.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gwynethpaltrow</a><p>Donovan Leitch and Gwyneth Paltrow in 1992 (per Gwyneth's Instagram caption)</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth Paltrow first dated multi-hyphenate Donovan Leitch.</h2><p>Gwyneth dated actor, model, and singer, Donovan Leitch.

However, Donovan shared that their kiss was purely innocent.</p><p>“I was just saying goodbye to her,” Donovan told the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> DailyMail</a>. “It was purely innocent. We were sitting in the owner’s box in front of 30,000 people with her two children right next to us. That isn’t exactly the setting for a secret liaison.”</p><p>Donovan also shared that he and Gwyneth are close friends and that they “have tons of great friends in common.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth quietly dated ‘House’ star Robert Sean Leonard.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!

And I had such a pleasing issue. I didn't really even understand how to listen to my instincts and act from that place for what was right for me. I was always trying to adjudicate what was right for everyone else."</p><p>Gwyneth also shared that she experienced the “major, major love at first sight” feeling with Brad and said that she was “totally heartbroken” when they separated.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gwyneth went on to have an on-again, off-again relationship with Ben Affleck.</h2><p>Gwyneth and Ben dated from 1997 to 2000 with an on-again, off-again relationship dynamic.
