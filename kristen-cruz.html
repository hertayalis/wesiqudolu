Her work is her primary concern, thus she is putting in a lot of effort to establish a solid foundation for her future profession. She primarily exercises and practices her voice.</p><h2><span id=Kristen_Cruz-_Professional_Career>Kristen Cruz- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Kristen Cruz began her career as a TikTok celebrity. Kristen’s TikTok videos have been viewed by 47.5 million people. She presently has over 2 million TikTok followers. She often plays hit song covers while doing mundane tasks such as brewing coffee. Her cover of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy” has been viewed by over 23 million people.</p><p>Her cover of George Michael’s “Careless Whisper” has received over 18 million views.

Cruz stated that her goal is to “inspire others and transmit the concept that you don’t have to be anything other than who you are.” I’m not compelled to meet industry standards.” Cruz’s audition performance wowed Cowell, Klum, Mandel, and Vergara, but they aren’t her only celebrity fans.</p><p>Ellen Pompeo from Grey’s Anatomy, Arian DeBose from West Side Story, and actor David Arquette are all fans of her on Instagram, where she also shows off her incredible voice.

We must state unequivocally that her historic step will have an indelible influence on her life. Kristen made her AGT debut on June 21, when the fourth round of season 17 auditions aired. Kristen disclosed in an Instagram post from May 30 that she had applied to AGT.</p><p>I auditioned for @agt! I’m overjoyed to tell you! “God is so lovely!” she wrote. Her performance astounded the judges, with Cowell applauding her “unbelievable” audition. Was that you singing, he wondered later? I was surprised because many of the overconfident singers who perform here are bad, so I wasn’t alone. Your voice is “seasoned,” in my opinion. You’re not a rookie like that. Your vocal range and tone are excellent.</p><p>You have wonderful taste, by the way, because the music was a fantastic pick. Mandel went on, “You open your mouth and you’re on fire.” Klum gushed, “I adore everything about you.” You’ve already got the makings of a superstar. You simply have “it,” a true gift. Vergara was among Cruz’s admirers, adding, “The minute you started singing, you became so powerful, so confident.”</p><p>It was both surprising and enticing!” Cruz’s AGT audition appeared on Tuesday’s broadcast, and many people have been applauding it online since then. “This little lady is great!” one fan wrote on Twitter. Her voice is incredible, with hints of Janice Joplin and Adele. She should have gotten the golden buzzer!</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Kristen has posted videos of herself doing lovely renditions of Christian music on Instagram and TikTok.
