But we often don’t take into account the hardships the fans endure in their bid to be loyal fans — like braving unruly crowds, standing for hours at end, or extreme sweltering heat in 23-year-old Ana’s case.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=657 data-injectable=true>For now, all that is known about Ana is she was a passionate Swiftie who was at a stadium in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to attend Taylor Swift’s concert on Nov. 17, 2023. She had been at the venue since 11 am, fanning herself to somehow beat the intense heat as she hoped to claim a front spot when the concert started.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=435 data-injectable=true>As reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a>, after approximately eight hours of battling the blistering sun and temperatures as high as 100F, Ana fainted and suffered a cardiac arrest. But after being tended to by the first responders, she was revived at the stadium as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shared by her friend, Thiago Fernandes</a>. Unfortunately, she went into a second cardiac arrest on the way to the Salagdo Filho Hospital and passed away during emergency care after arrival.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>Ana had been excited to attend Taylor’s concert for a long time, as shared by Thiago in his tribute post to his friend on Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by thiago fernandes (@thxaguito)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>He also wants Ana’s picture to appear on the screens during Taylor Swift’s concert.
