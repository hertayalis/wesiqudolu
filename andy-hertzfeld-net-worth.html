He is an inventor and computer scientist, probably best known for being a former programmer in Apple Computer. He is also recognized as the co-founder of three companies – Radius, General Magic, and Eazel. Currently he works for Google as a designer of Google+. His professional career has been active since 1979.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Andy Hertzfeld is? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Andy’s net worth is over $50 million, as of mid-2016. The main source of this amount of money is coming from his professional and successful career as a computer scientist, designer, as well as an inventor and founder of several companies. Additional to this, he has appeared in several TV shows, which have also added to his wealth.</p><h3>Andy Hertzfeld Net Worth $50 Million</h3><p>Andy Hertzfeld spent his childhood in his hometown, Philadelphia, and later he moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he attended Brown University, from which he graduated with a Computer Science degree in 1975. Then, Andy moved to California, where he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>In no time, Andy’s professional career began in 1978 when he bought his first computer – an Apple II – and subsequently started to develop his own software for it. Soon after, he was employed by the original Apple Computer company in 1979 as a programmer, and designer of the Macintosh system software; afterwards he developed the Apple SilenType printer firmware for the Sup’R’Terminal. He stayed with the company until 1984, working as a primary software architect, which largely increased the overall size of his net worth, as he developed the User Interface Toolbox, the ROM code, the Control Panel and Scrapbook. Thus, he became known as a “Software Wizard”; however, he left Apple and started a career on his own, founding several companies which have also added to his net worth.</p><p>In 1986 Andy started his first company named Radius, together with Burrell Smith, Alain Rossmann and other members of the original Mac team. The company was focused on making peripherals and accessory equipment for Macintosh. Four years later he founded his second company -General Magic – alongside Bill Atkinson and Marc Porat; the company was based in California, and it developed a new kind of communications device called a “personal intelligent communicator”. Furthermore, in 1999 Andy established Eazel, a software company based in Mountain View, California. All of these companies contributed a lot to the overall size of Andy’s net worth.</p><p>In 2005, Andy joined Google, and ever since then has been an essential part of the Google+ platform. A year before he joined the Google, he launched the website folklore.org, which contained funny stories from his time at Apple, all of which were collected and published in the book entitled “Revolution In The Valley” (2004).</p><p>When it comes to speak about his personal life, little is known in the media about Andy Hertzfeld, except the fact that he has been married to Joyce McClure since 1998. Beside that, he is also known as a volunteer, who worked for the Open Source Applications Foundation in 2002 and 2003.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.319569120287><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Andy Hertzfeld</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$50 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 6, 1953</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>American computer scientist, inventor, member of Apple Macintosh development team</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Education</td><td>Brown University, University of California, Berkeley</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Joyce McClure (m. 1998 -_)</td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>Google+</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://plus.google.com/+AndyHertzfeld</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0381115</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Movies</td><td>"Welcome to Macintosh" (2008), "Hackers: Wizards of the Electronic Age" (1984), "Jobs" (2013), "Steve Jobs" (2015)</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>"Triumph of the Nerds" (1996)</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=9><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Us Festival 1982: The US Generation Documentary</td><td>2013</td><td>Documentary</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>John Wants Answers</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Steve Jobs: Billion Dollar Hippy</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself, former Apple's software developer</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Welcome to Macintosh</td><td>2008</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Himself - Co-Creator of The Mac</td></tr><tr><td>In Search of the Valley</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>The Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires</td><td>1996</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself (designer, Macintosh Development Team)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Hackers: Wizards of the Electronic Age</td><td>1984</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself - Macintosh Programmer;
